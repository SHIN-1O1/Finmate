## Slide 1 — Title
**FinMate**
Investor Market Research & Fundability Memo (PFM + Wealth Habits for India)

Subtitle: Role-based AI finance coach • Safe-to-spend daily limit • Habit loop

---

## Slide 2 — Executive summary
- FinMate targets a real pain: day-to-day spending control + habit formation
- Category risk: PFM is crowded and retention is historically hard
- Fundability is **conditional** on retention + distribution wedge proof
- Next milestone: prove “first aha” in <5 min + strong Day-30 retention

---

## Slide 3 — Problem (user POV)
- “I don’t know where my money goes.”
- “I overspend early in the month, then scramble.”
- “Budgeting apps feel like homework; I quit.”
- “I want one number that tells me what’s safe today.”

---

## Slide 4 — Why now (timing)
- Digital payments increase transaction frequency → manual tracking breaks
- Retail investing and SIP awareness is mainstreaming
- Users increasingly accept AI copilots for daily decisions

(Insert latest UPI transaction stats from NPCI once you’re ready to cite numbers.)

---

## Slide 5 — Product in 1 sentence
FinMate is an India-focused, AI-assisted personal finance manager that converts spending inputs into budgeting guardrails, goals, and a daily “safe-to-spend” number—personalized by role.

---

## Slide 6 — Key product pillars (what’s on the tin)
- Role-based onboarding (Student / Professional / Housewife)
- Daily safe spending limit + budget split logic
- Goals + emergency fund progress
- AI recommendations + nudges
- Multi-modal expense capture (manual / voice / OCR / SMS parsing)

---

## Slide 7 — Evidence: usability + free tier matter (academic)
**TEM Journal (Aug 2024) — PFM app study**
- Usability friction reduces effectiveness:
  - “productivity… slower or limited due to the lack of a simplified interface…”
- Free tier matters:
  - “The importance of having a free subscription plan… should not be underestimated…”

## Slide 8 — ICP (initial wedge)
Primary: Urban India, 18–35
- Students + early-career professionals
- High UPI/card frequency, budget anxiety, inconsistent saving

Secondary:
- Household budget managers (recurring expenses + goals)

---

## Slide 9 — Jobs-to-be-done (JTBD)
- Control: stay within limits without deprivation
- Clarity: understand drivers (categories, patterns)
- Planning: allocate income across fixed expenses, goals, discretionary
- Confidence: “Can I spend X today?”
- Motivation: streaks/badges/nudges to keep the habit alive

---

## Slide 10 — Market framing (PFM/financial wellness)
- Subsector: Personal Finance Management + Financial Wellness
- Not a bank, not a broker: a **behavior layer** on top of spending

TAM/SAM/SOM (replace with cited numbers when available):
- TAM: very large smartphone + banked + digital payments users
- SAM: urban app-installing fintech users
- SOM: 0.2–1.0M engaged users in 24–36 months (with strong retention)

---

## Slide 11 — Competitive landscape (who users compare you to)
Direct:
- Spend trackers + budgeting apps (legacy + global)

Indirect/substitutes:
- Investment-first apps with analytics
- Neobanks with spend insights
- Spreadsheets/notes (and doing nothing)

Switch driver:
- win the daily decision moment (safe-to-spend + next action)

---

## Slide 12 — Differentiation (what’s actually different)
- Role-based personalization is first-class, not a template
- Multi-modal capture attacks the #1 retention killer: logging fatigue
- Habit loop: daily number + streaks + nudges (behavior change > reporting)

---

## Slide 13 — Moat (how this becomes defensible)
Reality check:
- Features are copyable

Defensibility must come from:
- measurable retention advantage
- distribution wedge (creator/campus/B2B2C)
- trust + brand in “daily money guidance”

---

## Slide 14 — Business model (what people pay for)
Users won’t pay for “tracking.” They pay for:
- automation (less effort)
- confidence (forecasting, safe-to-spend)
- compliance/value moments (exports, tax-saving guidance)

Pricing hypothesis (India): ₹99–299/month premium

---

## Slide 15 — Go-to-market (practical)
Beachhead: students + first-job professionals in metros
Channels:
- finance creators (shareable safe-to-spend + streaks)
- campus ambassador programs
Then:
- employer financial wellness pilots (B2B2C)

---

## Slide 16 — Traction metrics investors will demand
- Onboarding completion rate
- Time-to-aha (<5 minutes)
- D7 / D30 retention
- Weekly active check-ins
- % expenses captured automatically vs manual
- Paid conversion + churn

---

## Slide 17 — Risks (say the quiet part out loud)
- Retention risk (PFM graveyard)
- Trust risk (data sensitivity)
- Monetization risk (paid PFM in India is hard)
- Differentiation risk (copyability)

Mitigations:
- focus on capture automation + daily value
- transparent privacy + trust posture
- wedge GTM + measurable retention targets

---

## Slide 18 — Funding recommendation + milestones
Recommendation: **Conditional fundability** (pre-seed)
Capital use (12–18 months): prove retention + repeatable acquisition
Milestones:
- wedge ICP validated
- category-leading D30 retention
- pricing validated or B2B pilots
- trust posture + clear positioning
