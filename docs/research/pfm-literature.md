### Investor-relevant takeaways (quotes worth citing)

1) **Users need help managing personal finance**
> “At present, more and more consumers need help in managing their personal finances.”

2) **Usability is a key failure mode of existing tools**
> “The overall productivity for users of such software is often slower or limited due to the lack of a simplified interface through which they can easily and conveniently access information for quick and accurate data entry.”

3) **Free tier matters for adoption**
> “The importance of having a free subscription plan to use this type of software should not be underestimated either.”

4) **Despite many products, unmet needs remain**
> “Even with the number of software products available in the chosen field, there remains a necessity for a software solution that will bring together all the requirements of users and provide free mobile access to personal finance management.”

### How to use this in the FinMate pitch

- **Problem validation**: cite (1) to support increasing consumer demand for help managing finances.
- **Why incumbents fail**: cite (2) to support “logging friction + complexity kills adoption.”
- **GTM/pricing**: cite (3) to justify starting freemium in early traction.
- **Market whitespace**: cite (4) to justify why building a new solution can still be rational.

### Notes / limitations

- The paper is not India-specific; it validates global PFM adoption challenges (simplicity + free tier).
- For India-specific hard numbers (UPI volume/value, savings rates, SIP participation), use primary datasets: NPCI, RBI, SEBI, World Bank Findex.
